## Part 3: Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation

In this part of the project, we:

- Removed `setDetails()` methods.
- Introduced constructors for both `Student` and `Course` classes.
- Implemented automatic ID generation using static counters.
- Verified output by creating multiple student and course instances.
